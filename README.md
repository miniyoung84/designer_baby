Background

It has been a long time since the creation of our team’s Discord bot, meaning that the quality and structure is likely not to par or outdated. We have grown as engineers since the creation of the bot and would like to showcase our improvement by creating a new bot that will handle all important existing functionalities of the current bot, in addition to architecting a way that would make it easier to extend this bot for other functions.

The existing bot, which is named the ‘Teresa Walker’ bot, has been used in ‘The Bakery’ Discord server for several years and we are looking to improve the quality of the bot while maintaining parity with its current features.
